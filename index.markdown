Welcome to my site! Not everything is working yet, but I've put this together using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Minimal-Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). I'm a software engineer and a web developer. I'm currently working on my university work, but I'm also interested in learning new things.
